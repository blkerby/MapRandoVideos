                <p>If you're interested in creating and sharing videos here, that would be fantastic! Reach out on the #development channel of the <a href="https://discord.gg/xvxphNw8na">Discord</a> and we can help set up an account for you. 
                
                <p>Here are some things to keep in mind while creating your videos:
                <ul>
                    <li>Video must be in uncompressed AVI format, captured directly from an accurate emulator.</li>
                    <li>Avoid external capture, e.g. using OBS or CamStudio, as it will have quality problems.</li>
                    <li>See <a href="#" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#emulatorModal">here</a> for detailed emulator-specific instructions.</li>
                    <li>Use the <a href="https://smpractice.speedga.me/">Practice ROM</a> to show inputs, and use InfoHUD to show other relevant info if applicable.</li>
                    <li>Set Infohud > Timer Settings > Frame Counters to "INGAME".</li>
                    <li>It is recommended to apply the following patches:
                        <ul>
                            <li><a href="https://github.com/blkerby/MapRandomizer/raw/main/patches/ips/fast_pause_menu.ips">Fast pause menu</a> patch, to help make the videos more concise.</li>
                            <li><a href="https://github.com/blkerby/MapRandomizer/raw/main/patches/ips/rng_fix.ips">RNG fix</a> patch, to ensure enemy RNG works as it would in the randomizer.</li>
                        </ul></li>
                    <li>If a strat involves a setup from a previous room, include this as part of the video.</li>
                    <li>Pause and show the equipment screen at the end of the video (unless already shown as part of the strat).</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Tips for filling out the upload form:
                <ul>
                    <li>The logic info (room name, from/to node ID, and strat) is optional. It helps if you can fill it in, but feel free to leave any part blank if you're unsure.</li>
                    <li>The "Note" field doesn't need to repeat information that is in the strat logic. It's generally fine to leave it blank. It can be used to give detail if a strat doesn't yet exist in logic, or to distinguish multiple videos for the same strat.</li>
                    <li>A preview will be shown for a thumbnail image and animated highlight. Adjust these to focus on key moments of the strat. Between 3 and 10 seconds is typically a good length for a highlight.</li>
                    <li>All submissions can be edited later and will be reviewed before being integrated into the randomizer site, so no need to worry about any mistakes!</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The recommended process is to first create a "movie" recording and then convert it to an AVI while playing it back within the emulator.<a href="#footnote-movie"><sup>1</sup></a> This way you can retry the strat as many times as you like, by loading from a save state, without having to manually restart the recording every time and without having to trim down the video at the end.</p>

                <sup>1</sup>A "movie" is a recording of the sequence of inputs (along with a starting save state of the SNES RAM), so it will be a tiny file compared to the AVI which contains the rendered video and audio.
